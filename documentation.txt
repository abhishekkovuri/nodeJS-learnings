Node JS —— Node itself is written C++, V8 engine converts JS code into C++ code ————

Command Line interface
	Type commands in your computer rather than clicking with mouse

Arguments 	Values you give your program that effect how it runs

Javascript engine converts JS code into processor’s understandable language.

Javascript code ——> V8 Engine ——> machine code  we can also embed V8 in our own C++ programme  Servers and clients 
————————— Node Js is server technology
Server is a computer that performs services
Clients asks for services.


The main goal of nodeJs is we can write server side and client side can be of one programming language instead of multiple languages like Java, c#, etc 

What does JS needs to manage a server:
	1. Ways to deal with Files 	2. Ways to deal with Databases 	3. Ability to communicate over internet 	4. Ability to accept and send responses.
	5. Ways to deal with works which takes much time.


Foundational Elements of Node is  	1. Modules — A Reusable block of code who existence does not impact other code.
	2. Exports
	3. Require


Node JS implements CommonJS Modules
CommonJS modules are an agreed upon standard for how code modules should be structured.

Require here used to import the modules into a file  module.exports will help if at all you want to use certain functions of module, it is where module allows to make it available for other files or code
 

What is primitive datatypes 
	It is the type of data which represents single value.


Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) — these have the same intention as the module which never effects the other code and also will be executed as soon as it is declared



How do Module.exports and require works ?
Require is a function where you pass the path 
Module.exports is what require function returns  Use module.exports not exports even though it is shorthand



NODE PACKAGE MANAGER
-------------------------
semantic versioning
---- it is required to know the changes occured in which version so that it will be easier to track the changes 
semantic here means which means something


for example 
	MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
	1.7.2



Express
--------------
Express made webserver to build easier, which is one of popular package.
It is a middleware application which lies between request and responses.

it is unopinionated which means they are lots of choices


Template Engine in express translate the text into Html ultimately.

Jade is one of the popular package for this 
EJS - Effective Javascript templating.




REST api
----------------
REST ---- Representational State Transfer

it is following good Url Structure like 

		//get 
		app.get('/api/person/:id', (req, res) => {
			//get from database
		})

		//post
		app.post('/api/person', (req, res) => {
			//save to database
		})

		//delete 
		app.delete('/api/person/:id', (req, res) => {
			//delete from database
		})



App Structuring
-----------------
normally express generator will help the app to be in a particular structured


Javascript, JSON, Databases
----------------------------
Javascipt stores the information in Array of objects 
MySql has good options to use it in node -- open source 
	it is written in javascript and driven by node js 
	so need of any compilation here.

Nosql is non structured.



MEAN Stack 
-----------------
Stack ---- It is a piece of software which is build by combining the technologies.

MongoDb, Mongoose
Express
Angular 
Nodejs
